The basis of our grid system is [`<Flex>`](#flex). This enables flexible, responsive layouts with any number of
columns.

In practice, however, it's useful to assume a 12 column grid and only use widths that evenly divide 12
(eg, `1/2`, `1/3`, `1/4` or `1/6`).

```jsx
// loadExample('./gridExampleHalf')
```

You can use spacing units to achieve gutters between columns:

```jsx
// loadExample('./gridExampleGutters')
```
