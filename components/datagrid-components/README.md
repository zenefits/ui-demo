This package contains components that work with Zenefits Datagrid Backend.

### [DatagridContainer](https://github.com/zenefits/z-frontend/blob/master/components/datagrid-components/src/datagrid-container/DatagridContainer.tsx)

- This component was extracted from [Data Ingestion Flow app](https://github.com/zenefits/z-frontend/tree/master/apps/datagrid-flow) so that we can reuse it in other apps.

- The major part of this component is a [DataLayout](http://ui.zenefits.com/#!/DataLayout) with a [EditableTable](http://ui.zenefits.com/#!/EditableTable) that works with Zenefits Datagrid Backend.
