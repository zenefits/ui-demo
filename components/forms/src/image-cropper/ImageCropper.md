Allows the user to crop an image using mouse or touch. Selection can be nudged with the keyboard.

#### Examples

```jsx noeditor
<StorybookExample selectedKind="forms|ImageCropper" selectedStory="default" />
```

#### Implementation Notes

This component doesn't provide a preview or file uploads. In most cases, you probably want ImageUploadModal for use in an application.
