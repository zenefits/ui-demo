StatusTags are used to clearly label an object with a status or category.
It comes with predefined modes including failure and success.

#### Examples

```jsx noeditor
<StorybookExample selectedKind="elements|StatusTag" selectedStory="modes" />
```

#### Usage

- Label with short, easily scannable text.
- Position the tag to clearly indicate which thing has the status.
- Do _not_ use when there are many different values; just use text instead. Otherwise, your page may end up looking like a Christmas tree.
- Do _not_ make tags interactive.
