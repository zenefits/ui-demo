# babel-preset-z-frontend

Provides a babel preset to be used by packages in this repo.

## Installation

You shouldn't need to install this since all react apps and components will use z-frontend-webpack, which includes this as a dependency. The configuration for `babel-preset-z-frontend` is set at the root of the repo, and apps generally don't need to override it. Apps could define their own `.babelrc` if they need to override something.
