#### Finding Our Voice

Zenefits is:

- Bold: Keep the fluff out and the facts straight. Speak directly to issues and ideas, not around them.
- Personable: We’re not robots! The audience should always be able to tell someone’s on the other side of their screen.
- Optimistic: Everything for employers is changing, but we offer an exciting perspective because we love the
  opportunity that comes with this new world.
- Inclusive: Speak from perspective and empathize with your audience first and foremost. There are no right and wrong
  companies, just people working hard.

#### _It’s evocative, not provocative._

Don’t:

- Tell people how to be employers or employees: Every business has different needs for different reasons.
- Take credit for other’s success: We’re partners tackling HR, not in charge. Zenefits helps businesses grow, we don't
  cause it.
- Use inaccessible language: If it came from the backend or a legal document, it likely won’t belong in Zenefits. Keep
  it colloquial and don’t be condescending.
